Release notes for WordCram 0.5, 2011-05-11:

* PDF support! It's simple to use: just output your sketch to a
  PDF. None of your WordCram code has to change. If you'd like to see
  an example, go to Processing's Examples menu, and check out WordCram
  > OtherExamples > renderToPdf.

  My ignorance of Processing's internals made this feature take much
  longer than it needed to. The fix turned out to be a one-line change
  (an improvement, really) to the way word-shapes are rendered. But
  it's here now, ready for you to make something amazing and hi-res.

* Works with Processing 1.5. This was largely a side-effect of the PDF
  support, but it also meant moving the tutorials & examples around to
  fit in Processing's new floating "Examples" menu.

* Added word-padding, so words don't get so close. The method is
  WordCram.withWordPadding(int padding).

* Updated all the examples, to make sure they work properly. Some of
  them were using black backgrounds, and since the default word color
  was changed to black (back in March), these were pretty unhelpful.


Release notes for WordCram 0.4.1, 2011-03-27:

* Bug fix for issue 10: unicode characters in text don't show up in
  the image.


Release notes for WordCram 0.4, 2011-03-17:

WordCram 0.4 changes center around three themes: styling words
directly; knowing whether a Word was placed or skipped, and why; and
finer control over the rendering process.

* If you're creating and weighting your own Words, you can pre-set
  their styles by calling setAngle(), setColor(), setFont(),
  setSize(), and/or setPlace(). These values will pre-empt the rules
  set by the WordAngler, etc. Added getRenderedAngle(),
  getRenderedColor(), etc, so you can tell how it all turned out.

* Back-ported to run on Java 1.5, to match Processing, and updated the
  source build to use Processing 1.2.1.

* Added tutorial sketches, which walk you through WordCram in a more
  orderly way than the examples. Also added a few examples, and moved
  the sample text files & font files up, to shrink the download size.

* Added getWordAt(x,y).

* Added getSkippedWords(), which returns a Word[] of all words that
  were (so far) skipped, and getWords(), which returns a Word[] of all
  words the WordCram is looking at.

* Added wasPlaced(), wasSkipped(), and wasSkippedBecause() to Word,
  along with static ints on WordCram for the reasons (NO_SPACE,
  etc). Also added this info to Word's toString() method, so you can
  just println(yourWord) and see some good info.

* Dropped BBTree minimum size from 7 to 1 - there's no noticable
  slow-down, and it should make more accurate collision detection.

* Added withCustomCanvas(PGraphics), so a WordCram can be drawn to a
  PGraphics besides the sketch it's running in, and getProgress(), to
  provide feedback while it's rendering to the customCanvas. WordCram
  throws an exception if you try to pass it a P2D buffer, though -
  only JAVA2D works.

* Added maxAttemptsForPlacement(int), which tells WordCram to only
  try so many times to place a word.

* Added maxNumberOfWordsToDraw(int), which limits how many words
  WordCram will try to draw.

* Added minShapeSize(int), to weed out words that render to Shapes
  smaller than the given size.

* Added WordCram methods fromHtmlFile() and withColor(); made
  fromTextString() and fromHtmlString() n-arity (so they can be used
  w/ loadStrings() more easily).

* Changed Word.weight from a double to a float, so we can all stop
  casting.

* Added StopWords.GERMAN. Thank you, Felix, Marco, and Steffen!

* Deleted deprecated methods currentWord() and currentWordIndex().

* Reorganized text-parsing classes to make some classes (Html2Text)
  unavailable in the Processing sketch, to declutter the API.

* RandomWordNudger: you can now pass the standard deviation to use as
  a constructor parameter.

* Word now has methods getProperty(String name) and setProperty(String
  name, Object value).  The firstnamesUsingWordProperties example
  sketch shows how it works. Properties can be useful with a custom
  WordPlacer, WordColorer, etc.


Release notes for WordCram 0.3.1, 2010-11-10:

* Bug fix: in 0.3, the WordCram library folder under Processing was 
  renamed from wordcram to WordCram, but the .jar was still 
  wordcram.jar, so Processing didn't load it.  Renamed it to 
  WordCram.jar.


Release notes for WordCram 0.3, 2010-11-07:

* Added TextSource, so WordCram can count words from different kinds
  of source, including web pages and text files.
* Added a fluent API for building WordCrams: 
  new WordCram(this).forWebPage("{url}").sizedByWeight(10, 100).
* Added case-sensitive word counting, and the ability to exclude
  numeric words.
* Added javadoc comments for lots of classes -- more to come.
* Added Processing examples: in Processing, look under File >
  Sketchbook > libraries > WordCram > examples.
* Bug fix: issue 1, Stop-words with punctuation have no effect.
* Added StopWords.JAVA for making WordCrams from java source code.
* Added Anglers.heaped(), Anglers.randomBetween(min,max),
  Colorers.twoHuesRandomSatsOnWhite(), and
  Placers.horizBandAnchoredLeft().
* Deprecated old WordCram constructors, WordCram.currentWord(), and
  WordCram.currentWordIndex().
* Changed minimum shape size from 4 to 7, to speed up rendering.
* WaveWordPlacer and SwirlWordPlacer no longer randomly offset
  placement, so they should look crisper.
* Improved SpiralWordNudger's spiralling, so more words should show,
  and faster.
